	<h1>Career Goals</h1>
	
	<p>
		Right now, I think being a professer at Yale would be awesome. Another thing that would be super cool would be being a sewer/fashion desigenr and 
		even a professional cook. All these ambitions could change within the next couple years.
	</p>
	<h1>My Titles and Portrayed Self</h1>
	
	<p>
		Some titles I've held would be CEO and class representative. I was CEO of a school store I ran with 3 other people. We came in first competing against
		two other teams. I've also been class representative two years in a row, and plan to continue being a part of the Student Body Office. I'm a very hard working 
		ambitious student and person. My ambitions have led me to work hard to become a part of the two highest teams at my dance studio, and be the in the top in my class 
		at my old school.
